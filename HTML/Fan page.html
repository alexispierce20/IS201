                    One of the biggest mysteries in The Office is the identity of the Scranton Strangler.
                    Here are a few of the most common suspects of who the strangler could be.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Toby Flenderson</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He was on the Jury of of the Svranton Stangler case but feels like they imprisoned the wrong man.</li>
                            <li>The Office coworkers gather around Toby's computer to watch a police chase with the Scranton Stangler but suspiciously, Toby is not there. Could he be in the runway car?</li>
                            <li>He has a sad personal life with bottled up rage.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>George Howard Skub (the man convicted)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Found guilty of the strangling crimes against a jury.</li>
                            <li>When Toby visits Skub in prison, Skub strangles Toby.</li>
                            <li>After he was imprisoned, the attacks stopped happening.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Creed Bratton</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He is not opposed to voilence. There are times were it is suggested that Creed has murdered someone before.</li>
                            <li>He is often unpredictable and mysterious.</li>
                        </ul>

            <!-- JIM'S ICONIC PRANKS -->
            <section id="pranks" class="section">
                <h2>My favorite pranks Jim has played on Dwight</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most classic reoccuring moments on The office is Jim Halpert's legendary pranks on Dwight.
                    It is hard to choose my favorite here is a list of some of the best!
                </p>
                <div class="image-wrapper">
                    <img src="../assets/img/jim-impersonates-dwight.avif" height="200" alt="Jim dresses up like Dwight">
                    <p class="image-caption">“Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!”</p>
                </div>
                <!-- Simple list (no more boxes) -->
                <ol class="pranks-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Identity theft:</strong>
                        Jim comes to work dressed exactly like Dwight, outfit, hair, glasses, mannerisms, and all!
                        This leads to the iconic line: “Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!” 
                        Jim's impression of Dwight is spot on, all the way down to Dwights classic scream for their boss Michael.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dwight’s Stapler in Jell-O:</strong>
                        This one is iconic because it is the first prank we see Jim play on Dwight.
                        Jim places Dwight's stapler in Jello-O making it a harmless but inconvient prank for Dwight.
                        It is a great first prank to set the tone for the series and provide a point to grow off of into more epic pranks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Asian Jim:</strong>
                        Jim convinces one of his actor friends to come to the office pretending to be Jim. They even changed the family photo on the desk 
                        to include the new "Asian" Jim just to sell the bit even further. This causes Dwight to question his own sanity.
                        Asian Jim is played by actor Randall Park and this is, in my opinion, one of the funniest pranks ever done on the show.
                        I love how far Jim and Pam go inorder to make Dwight believe that this replacement has always been Jim!

                    Not all pranks are on Dwight. Sometimes The Office coworkers pull pranks on each other.
